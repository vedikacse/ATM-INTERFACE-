🎉 Project Launched: ATM INTERFACE System
I'm thrilled to share the ATM INTERFACE project I recently developed as part of my learning journey at Government College of Engineering, Yavatmal (CSE Department).

📌 Project Overview:
This is a console-based ATM simulation system developed using the C programming language. It replicates basic real-world ATM functionalities, offering a hands-on experience in building a banking interface.

🔑 Key Features:
🔐 Secure Login: Card number and PIN verification

💰 Balance Inquiry

🏧 Cash Withdrawal (with sufficient balance validation)

💵 Cash Deposit

🔄 PIN Change (validates old PIN before updating)

✅ Advantages:
Gained practical exposure to modular programming and structured coding in C

Improved skills in user input handling, conditional logic, and basic data storage

Developed a deeper understanding of real-world banking workflows

This project marked my first submission for C-Rush2.0 — and I couldn’t be more excited about the outcome!
